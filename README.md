# java-modernization-labs
A collection of hands-on Java projects exploring new features from Java 9 to Java 21, along with concurrency, functional programming, and design principles

## Structure
- Each sprint is in its own folder, e.g., `day1-config-loader/`
  - `src/` — Source files
  - `resources/` — Supporting data (e.g., `.properties`)
  - `README.md` — Sprint-specific documentation

## Goals
- Become fluent with modern Java (post–Java 8)
- Build concurrency, functional programming, and OO design skills
- Create GitHub-ready artifacts for your portfolio

## Tools
- Java 17 (primary target)
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Maven or Gradle (as desired)
